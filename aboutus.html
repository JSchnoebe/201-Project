            <p>Hello, my name is Jaren Schnoebelen. I am new to DeltaV, but loving it so far. I chose to join DeltaV because I enjoy creating/building new things and I like working with computers. My favorite thing about coding and web development would have to be HTML & CSS. I feel pretty confident in making the web page look nice. I still need to work on my JavaScript skills, because I have the least amount of knowledge in that, but it will come with time. I also love music and sports. My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and my favorite sports team is the Chicago Cubs.</p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Susan  Hargus
               My family and I moved to Mount Vernon from Los Angles almost 20 years ago.
               I graduated with. BFA from the U of Iowa and I trained at an Atelier in Minneapolis in the painting manner known as ‘Classical Realism’. I came to 
               DeltaV because I aways had an interest in coding. I look at coding as a skill that is creative and employs that same kind of deep thinking one uses when creating art. It’s inherently creative qualities and ever evolving nature provide the opportunity of discovery and learning that are now in the present time unknown to me . I really enjoy people and am told I am easy to work with.

            <p>My name is Mike.  I'm from Cedar Rapids and have lived there most of my life.  I've had various jobs, mostly in customer and food service.
               I love computers and wanted to learn how to code for a long time before coming to DeltaV.  I'm excited to continue to develop my skills at DeltaV code school.
               I hope to take what I've learned here and apply it to a long successful career in software development.
