# Project Week-201

## MovieDex

This app is meant to give random movie suggestions based on a choice of genre and MPAA rating. It is easy to use and the instructions are presented simply. On the initial page you enter your name and receive a message.  Then you click on one of the four images representing four different genres.  Then you pick one of three age ratings.  Once you do that it will take you to a page with three movies that match your choices.  On each page there is also a navigation bar, with links to a page about the creators of the app, and a link to the home page.
